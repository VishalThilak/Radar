# Radar

A small radar used to identify how far objects are.

## Description

This project was made to simulate a real radar and sonar. Theres an ultrasonic sensor and emits
high frequency waves to determine how far an object is and to determine if an object is even near
it. This combined with the servo motor allows to determine the locations of nearby objects in 
the near vacinty. The rgb led also helps in indicating if the sensor has seen an object or not. 
All this information is then graphed onto the screen to emulate a rdar like feel. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Install the Arduino IDE and Processing 4
* Install the Minim library in Processing 4
* Arduino microcontroller with ultrasonic sensor, servo motor,
rgb led, two 220k ohm resistors, jumper wires and a breadboard.

### Executing program

* Connect the components as seen in the diagram and pictures
* Connect the arduino microcontroller to your computer
* Open the .ino code and press the upload button
* Then open the .pde code and press the run button
